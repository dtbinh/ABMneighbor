ABMneighbor

This model is originally developed for the final project of AML 520 Agent-Based Modeling, taught by Dr. Marco A. Janssen. The goal is to explore how two neighborhood effects (queen and rook contiguity) influence the correlations between environmental gradients and species distributions. 

The model replicated the results of Travis et al. (2005) with further implementations.

I received lots of helps in replicating and revising this model from Dr. Marco A. Janssen and the TA, Nathan Rollins. Without their helps, the project cannot be completed. Any remaining errors are my responsibility.
